      <h1>ini apa?</h1>
      <p>
        it's a random idea given form, i guess. a mix between geocaching and a
        digital art project. i really like exploring this island and finding all
        the little secrets in it and i think it's just really cool to stumble
        upon something unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
        this is my way of capturing that feeling, that sense of wonderment and
        fascination when you find something random and new for the first time.

    <div>
      <h1>how does it work?</h1>
      <p>
        whenever i make a new digicache, i'll post a pic of it on instagram as
        well as directions to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
        if you end up finding it, DM me a pic of yourself with the qr-code on
        instagram, and i'll add you to the list of people who've found it.
